# Star Wars

This repo was used to practice Vue, specifically querying an API ([swapi](https://swapi.dev/)) and displaying the information sent back in a table. This project requires the axios library, so run the following command in the terminal within the project directory to install it. 
```
npm install --save axios
```

When the page is loaded, it will display a list of 10 characters from the Star Wars universe, as well as a  button to move to the next page. There will be a series of pages, containing up to 10 charcaters each until all the characters stored in the API have been listed. Then there will be one final page which displays all the characters currently available from the API at once. Please note that table sorting occurs on a full list basis and not on a page by page basis.
